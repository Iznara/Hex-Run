![hex image](./assets/Readme_slide.jpg)

## **About**

The last couple of weeks at the Northcoders bootcamp was spent working on this app as part of my final project. Myself and three team members worked together to create a social mobile app designed to make exercise fun. It combines the background GPS locating, data visualisation and statistic tracking features of a serious fitness app like Strava with a hexagonal game board, allowing players to claim territory from others in real time simply by going for a run, while constantly working towards achievements to level up.

## **Technologies**

React Native + Expo
Turf.js
Firebase
Geolib
Victory Charts
